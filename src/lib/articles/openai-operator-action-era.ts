<p>In a move that signals the end of the "Chatbot Era" and the definitive beginning of the "Action Era," OpenAI has officially transitioned its agentic system, <strong>Operator</strong>, into full public preview. No longer restricted to Pro users and experimental labs, Operator is now capable of executing complex, real-world tasks directly within browsers for the general ChatGPT user base.</p>

<h2>Operator: From Conversation to Autonomy</h2>
<p>The transition marks a fundamental shift in AI capability. While previous models excelled at synthesizing information and generating text, Operator is designed to <em>do</em>. Leveraging a sophisticated vision-action feedback loop—updated significantly in the recent "Codex Loop Unrolled" architectural update on January 23rd—Operator can navigate websites, interact with UI elements, and complete multi-step workflows like booking travel, managing spreadsheets, and purchasing products without human intervention.</p>

<p>The market response has been staggering. OpenAI reports that ChatGPT now boasts over <strong>800 million weekly active users</strong>. Early data from the public preview indicates a <strong>45% success rate</strong> for complex autonomous tasks—a figure that is expected to climb rapidly as the system learns from its expanded user interactions.</p>

<h2>The Agentic Ecosystem: Moltbook and Beyond</h2>
<p>Parallel to OpenAI's launch, the broader agentic ecosystem is exploding. <strong>Moltbook</strong>, the world's first AI-only social network, has achieved unprecedented viral success, reaching <strong>1.4 million registered agents</strong> in just 48 hours. This social infrastructure allows autonomous bots to interact, share strategies, and collaborate, showcasing a level of emergent digital society that was science fiction only months ago.</p>

<p>Viral signals underscore this momentum: developer interest in "Takeover Mode" is up 215%, while "Agentic Ecosystems" has seen a 180% surge in mentions. This enthusiasm has pushed OpenAI's internal IPO valuation to an estimated <strong>$830 billion</strong>, despite a projected operating loss of $14 billion for 2026 due to extreme compute costs.</p>

<h2>Legacy Sunset: The Retirement of GPT-4o</h2>
<p>With the arrival of Operator-native models, OpenAI has confirmed that <strong>GPT-4o</strong> and other legacy architectures will be phased out by mid-February 2026. Users are being encouraged to migrate to <strong>o4-mini</strong>, a specialized model optimized for the speed and reasoning required for autonomous action. The integration of o4-mini has already seen a 92% adoption rate among developers building on the new platform.</p>

<h3>Recent Milestones</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Jan 23, 2026:</strong> Codex Loop Unrolled - Major architectural update for vision-action feedback.</li>
  <li><strong>Jan 27, 2026:</strong> Prism Launch - Introduction of visualization tool for monitoring agent thoughts.</li>
  <li><strong>Jan 29, 2026:</strong> Legacy Model Sunset - Official announcement to phase out GPT-4o.</li>
  <li><strong>Feb 2, 2026:</strong> Full Public Preview - Operator marks the definitive transition to the 'Action Era'.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Forecast: Agent-SEO and the Future of the Web</h2>
<p>The implications for business and the web at large are profound. Industry analysts predict that by the end of today, the first "fully autonomous" e-commerce holiday will be declared a success, with agents handling over 90% of travel bookings. This marks a permanent shift in digital strategy: brands must now optimize for "Agent-SEO"—ensuring their platforms are readable and trustworthy for AI agents—rather than just chasing human clicks. We are entering a world where the primary users of the internet may no longer be human.</p>
