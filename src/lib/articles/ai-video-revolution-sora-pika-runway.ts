export const content = `Just when we thought AI image generation was magic, the next frontier arrived: text-to-video. With the announcement of OpenAI's Sora, the world got a glimpse of AI's potential to generate stunningly realistic and imaginative video clips from simple text prompts. The AI video revolution is no longer coming; it's here.\n\nBut Sora isn't the only player. Tools like <a href="/tools/pika">Pika</a> and <a href="/tools/runway">Runway</a> have already been empowering creators to generate and edit video with AI for some time. These platforms use complex diffusion models, similar to those in image generators, but adapted to create coherent motion across a sequence of frames. The result is a powerful new tool for storytelling, marketing, and art.\n\nThis technology democratizes filmmaking. An indie creator can now visualize a complex scene that would have once required a massive budget and a VFX team. It's also transforming workflows in major studios for storyboarding and pre-visualization. Of course, challenges remain. The potential for creating convincing "deepfakes," the massive computational power required, and the need for strong ethical guardrails are all issues that the industry is actively grappling with. As these tools evolve, they will undoubtedly redefine the future of visual media.`;
