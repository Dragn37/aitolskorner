<h2>Executive Summary: What You Need to Know Right Now</h2>

<p>Nerovet AI Dental has emerged as a discussed platform in dental artificial intelligence circles, but <strong>critical transparency issues exist</strong>. As of February 2025:</p>

<ul>
  <li>✗ <strong>No verified FDA clearance</strong> in public databases</li>
  <li>✗ <strong>No peer-reviewed clinical studies</strong> in PubMed, Web of Science, or Google Scholar</li>
  <li>✗ <strong>No official company website</strong> or transparent founder information</li>
  <li>✗ <strong>Limited verifiable clinical deployment</strong> data</li>
  <li>✓ <strong>Marketing materials appeared mid-2025</strong> with bold accuracy claims</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For comparison:</strong> FDA-cleared competitors like Overjet, Pearl, and VideaHealth have documented clearances, published studies, and transparent clinical validation.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> While the concept aligns with proven dental AI capabilities, Nerovet currently lacks the regulatory approval and clinical evidence required for informed adoption. This guide provides the complete picture.</p>

<p>A comprehensive meta-analysis of 116 systematic reviews revealed:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pooled Sensitivity:</strong> 0.85 (85% detection rate)</li>
  <li><strong>Pooled Specificity:</strong> 0.93 (93% correct exclusion of healthy tissue)</li>
  <li><strong>Area Under Curve (AUC):</strong> 0.95 (excellent discriminatory ability)</li>
  <li><strong>CNN Model Accuracy:</strong> 93.1% (91.19-95.05% confidence interval)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>VideaHealth Clinical Trial Results:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>43% reduction</strong> in missed cavities when using AI</li>
  <li><strong>15% reduction</strong> in false positive detections</li>
  <li><strong>46% increase</strong> in lesion detection (Heartland Dental study)</li>
  <li><strong>13% improvement</strong> in diagnostic accuracy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Clinical Performance Data: Real Numbers</h2>

<p>Meta-analysis of AI Dental Diagnostics (2025) confirms pooled accuracy rates of 93.1% for CNN-based models. Best performing systems achieve 95% accuracy in caries detection and >90% agreement with experts for bone level measurements.</p>

<blockquote>
  "The integration of AI acts as a reliable second opinion, reducing misdiagnosis by up to 30% while enhancing patient trust through objective visual evidence."
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>Expert Recommendations</h2>

<p>Based on current evidence, we recommend that dental practices avoid adopting any system—including Nerovet—that lacks verified FDA clearance and peer-reviewed validation. Practitioners should choose from proven platforms with documented evidence and transparent company histories.</p>

<p><strong>For patients:</strong> Always ask your dentist which specific AI system they are using and ensure they can explain the findings in plain language based on clinical correlation.</p>
